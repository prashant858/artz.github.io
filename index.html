		<h4>ALL ABOUT ANIME</h4>
		<p>Anime is a term for a style of Japanese comic book and video cartoon animation in which the main characters have large doe-like eyes. Many Web sites are devoted to anime. Anime is the prevalent style in Japanese comic books or manga .</p>
		<p>In Japan, though, animated shows are made for people of all ages, and it's commonplace for people in their 40s, 50s, and beyond to have favorite anime characters and shows.</p>
		<p>Japanese anime is different from cartoons. While both are caricatures that may be animated, anime usually has visually distinct features for characters, and a more "limited animation" style for depicting movement.</p>
